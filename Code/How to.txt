From an existing de novo identification job performed in PEAKS Studio (v 7.5 tested),
1. Open the de novo results page.
2. Select the "Summary" tab.
3. Click on "Export".
4. In the "Text Formats" tab, check "All de novo candidates (all de novo candidates.csv), uncheck the other options.
5. Save the .csv file in a working folder.
6. On the GitHub web site that contains the SequenceAssembly project, choose "Clone or download" and then choose "Download ZIP." 
7. Update the SequenceAssemblyMELD.java code with the correct path (line 24) and name (line 25) pointing to the exported .csv file (Please use the escaped double backslash "\\" to represent each backslash in the path, as required by Java).
8. Open a command prompt on a computer where the Java JDK has been installed. Change the current directory of the command prompt to the directory that contains the SequenceAssemblyMELD.java file. In the command prompt type "javac  SequenceAssemblyMELD.java"
9. Using the command prompt in the same directory as in step 7, type at the command prompt "java SequenceAssemblyMELD" that will execute the code.
10. After 1-2 minutes, the command prompt will begin printing information to the screen that is being generated by the code. This information is interesting but can be ignored. 
11. After several additional minutes a "Results_Redundancy30.txt" file will appear in the same directory. The size of this output file will increase continually over about 30 minutes, as the results from each seed sequence are appended to the file. The code has finished running when the command window returns to a command prompt.
